# LambdaCalculus

## Purpose
This repo contains my Scheme/Racket code for my various forays into learning about lambda calculus.

## A Flock of Functions
This file contains all my first lambda calculus explorations as I was writing down definitions and trying things for myself.

The acompanying writeup is at [my website](https://ericbreyer.com/assets/An_Introduction_to_the_Lambda_Calculus__Church_Encodings__and_the_Y_Combinator%20(1).pdf)

file name from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BnVo7EHO_8) that first kicked off my interest

## Scheme Syntax
My attempt to use macros to "write Scheme in Scheme", using pure lambda calculus as the only computation method.

Again, the acompanying writeup is at [my website](https://ericbreyer.com/assets/Pure_LC_Scheme_Macros.pdf)
